# BTC-Treasury-Tickers

This project hosts a small web page that lists companies with Bitcoin treasuries.
The data is loaded dynamically from the [data-btc-treasuries.com](https://github.com/baxter2/data-btc-treasuries.com) repository so the table is kept current.
Simply open `docs/index.html` in a browser to see the latest tickers and transaction dates.
