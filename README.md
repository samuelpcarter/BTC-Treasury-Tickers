# Portfolio and Demos

This site includes a simple portfolio with an interactive Rubik's Cube, a Bitcoin
price viewer, and placeholder pages for future content.

## Quick start

1. **Clone the repo** or download the contents as a zip.
2. **Open** `docs/index.html` in any modern browser. The page loads all
   JavaScript and CSS from the `docs` directory, so no build step is required.
3. **Interact with the Rubik's Cube** using the on-page buttons:
   - **Scramble** – performs a random set of turns.
   - **Solve** – reverses the scramble sequence.
   - **Reset** – returns the cube to its default orientation.
   The cube can also be rotated with your mouse while holding the left button.
4. **Explore** the other sample pages (such as `docs/bitcoin.html` and
   `docs/resume.html`) using the navigation links at the top of the page.

The original Bitcoin chart mentioned in earlier versions is now available at
`docs/bitcoin.html`.
