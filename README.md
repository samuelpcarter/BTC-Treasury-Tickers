# BTC-Treasury-Tickers

This project hosts a tiny web page that displays the current Bitcoin price.
The numeric value still comes from CoinGecko, but a TradingView chart is embedded so you can follow the live price action.
Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to see the chart and price updates every minute.
